# Mahara Local Plugin

This plugin allows your Moodle installation to subscribe to Mahara XML-RPC endpoints. Included is a table housing
portfolio's pulled from Mahara by other plugins.

While its original purpose is a requirement for the [Maraha assignment plugins][1], it can easily be extended to
support more XML-RPC endpoints.

## Installation

Installation of the plugin is very easy. There are two installation methods:

1. Download the source archive for this plugin, and extract at the following location: `{Moodle_Root}/local/mahara`
2. Execute the following command:

```
> git clone https://github.com/UniversityofPortland/moodle-local_mahara.git {Moodle_Root}/local/mahara
```

The remaining installation is taken care of by Moodle by clicking on *Notifications*.

## Associated plugins

There are currently two plugins that require this integration:

1. [Mahara assignment submissions][1]
2. [Mahara assignment feedback][2]
